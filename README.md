## Weapons (vopn in old norse) for the Java developer

This project contains a lot of nice things that I have developed and
used for a number of years. As such it is opinionated code (and
limited by my shortcommings :) so take whatever you like from this.

The inception of this code was as part of the ENSURE EU-project, but I
am breaking it out into a separate project to ease further use in
other projects.

This code is battle tested over a series of years in production and I
don't expect anything to break any time soon.

Available from Maven Central as:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.gautelis</groupId>
    <artifactId>vopn</artifactId>
    <version>2.3</version>
</dependency>

```
