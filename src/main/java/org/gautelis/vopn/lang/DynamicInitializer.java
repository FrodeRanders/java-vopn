/**
 * A dynamic initializer is used to initiate <i>dynamically loaded</i>
 * objects, see {@link  org.gautelis.vopn.lang.DynamicLoader}&lt;C&gt;.
 * <p>
 * Since dynamically loaded objects may not have elaborated
 * constructors (they <b>must</b> have a default constructor),
 * we are depending on calling some kind of initializer
 * subsequent to creating the object instance.
 *
 * This class wraps this behaviour when used together with
 * the {@link  org.gautelis.vopn.lang.DynamicLoader}&lt;C&gt;.
 * <p>
 * In the general case, use as follows:
 * <pre>
 *   final String arg0 = "holy";
 *   final String arg1 = "smoke";
 *
 *   <b>DynamicInitializer</b>&lt;<i>SomeClass</i>&gt; <b>di</b> = new <b>DynamicInitializer</b>&lt;<i>SomeClass</i>&gt;() {
 *       public void <b>initialize</b>(<i>SomeClass dynamicObject</i>) {
 *           dynamicObject.initialize(arg0, arg1);
 *       }
 *   };
 * </pre>
